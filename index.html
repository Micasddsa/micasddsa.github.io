 <h2>My Projects</h2>
 <p>Some projects you may have seen from me were...</p>
 <h3>Scratch.mit.edu Underground</h3>
 <p>This Project is very dead + old. üíÄ
 <h3>The Megalovania Library</h3>
 <p>This is a dwp library I created that contained most instruments. Not supported anymore.
 <h3>The Beepbox Soundfont</h3>
 <p>This project was probably my magnum opus or something. It is a soundfont that contained every preset synth from Beepbox from around that time. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1378">Download.</a> (This sampled a now old version of beepbox so expect some things to be different.)</p>
 <b>Jummbox Soundfont</b>
 <p>This Project while not technically mine is from another person that I sorta co-deved on. it's a way more superior fork of the program. kudos to stigia. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/2338">Download.</a>
 <h3>Shreddage 2 Amped with Revalver MK III.V Soundfont.</h3>
 <p>Probably the most legal gray area soundfont, also a bit successful. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1870">Download.</a></p>
 <h3>Beepbox Soundfont Reformatted</h3>
 <p>A remaster + resample of all the beepbox samples. may use directwave. Not finished yet.</p>
 <h3>Micasddsa's Addons</h3>
 <p>Bad MC mod that <b>I</b> made for no reason other than to screw around with MCreator. (1.19.2 Fabric.)</p>
