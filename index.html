    <h1>Welcome to Micasddsa.github.io! (My website!)</h1>
    <p>this entire website is composed hand made. (Meaning that I used no website editor. Just typed this all out.)</p>
    <p>(I get it, use carrd.co. But I like this better as I have a strange affinity for old tech.)</p>
      <div class="seperator">
       <h2>Places where you can find me</h2>
       <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/micasddsa">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/micasddsa/">Scratch</a></p>
       <p>And that is it. I am nowhere else. (It's easy to fine my Discord.)</p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
          <h3>Storybook</h3>
            <p>This this probably my life passion. Storybook is a collection of stories that I've worked on that will be readable for absolutely free and probably is mid.</p>
          <h3>VBStroy (Unfinished)</h3>
            <p>VBStory is a little story adventure made completely in Visual Basic Script. It in any windows version down to Windows XP. I aim to make this compatable with even the Windows 9x systems. (The game's story and humor is inspired off of Sheeptester's <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/thingkingland/bookmarklets/theHouse.html">The House</a> and <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/thingkingland/the-hotel/">The Hotel</a> but borrows elements from Storybook and shares the same universe.)</p>

        <h2>My Old Projects</h2>
          <p>Some projects you may have seen from me were...</p>
        <h3>The Megalovania Library</h3>
          <p>This is a dwp library I created that contained most instruments. Not supported anymore.
        <h3>The Beepbox Soundfont</h3>
          <p>This is a soundfont that contains sampled versions of every preset from Beepbox.co <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1378">Download.</a> (This sampled a now old version of beepbox so expect some things to be different.)</p>
           <b>Jummbox Soundfont</b>
              <p>This Project while not technically mine is from another person that I sorta co-deved on. it's a way more superior fork of the program. kudos to stgiga. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/2338">Download.</a>
        <h3>Shreddage 2 Amped with Revalver MK III.V Soundfont.</h3>
          <p>Probably the most legal gray area soundfont, also a bit successful. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1870">Download.</a></p>
