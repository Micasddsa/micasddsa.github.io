    <p>this entire website is composed hand made. (Meaning that I didn't use a website editor. Just typed this all out and maybe copy pasted from various sources.)</p>
    <p>(I get it, use carrd.co. But I like this better as I have a strange affinity for old tech.)</p>
    <h3>As a consequence of my design descision. This is not exactly optimized for mobile phones. But I am not exactly focused on that so basically, deal with it.</h3>

       <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/micasddsa">Soundcloud</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/micasddsa/">Scratch</a></p>
       <p>And that is it. I am nowhere else. (It's easy to find my Discord.)</p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
          <h3>Storybook</h3>
          <p>This this probably my life passion. Storybook is a collection of stories that I've worked on that will be readable for absolutely free and probably is mid.</p>
		        <h4>Project Pearl</h4>
	          <p>Project Pearl is a story about Jason. A young puzzle solver that stumbles across a mystery about his school's Game Development club.</p>
        	  <h4>Emerald's Story</h4>
            <p>Emearld's Story is a book that predates Project Pearl in both development and time. It focuses on a girl, her 2 siblings, and a strange amulet.</p>
          	<h4>Untitled Project</h4>
            <p>Untitled Project is a shrot story that takes place right smack in the middle of Project Pearl. During Pearl Rose's disappearance. It focuses on the promenent side-character, Sarah Hazel Mitchell.</p>
          <h3>VBStroy (Unfinished)</h3>
          <p>VBStory is a little story adventure made completely in Visual Basic Script. It in any windows version down to Windows XP. I aim to make this compatable with even the Windows 9x systems. (The game's story and humor is inspired off of Sheeptester's <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/thingkingland/bookmarklets/theHouse.html">The House</a> and <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/thingkingland/the-hotel/">The Hotel</a> but borrows elements from Storybook and shares the same universe.)</p>
	        <h3>VisualNovel.nds (Unfinished.)</h3>
	        <p>This visual novel for the Nintendo DSi systems focuses on the universe of Storybook and places you right in it. Very much a fever dream project.</p>
	        <h3>Storybook CD</h3>
	        <p>This project serves as a kind of "resume" for my musical skills. Focuses on making music not only for Storybook but also for just generally showing off my skills as a music producer.</p>

        <p>This is a soundfont that contains sampled versions of every preset from Beepbox.co <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1378">Download.</a> (This sampled a now old version of beepbox so expect some things to be different.)</p>
          <b>Jummbox Soundfont</b>
          <p>This Project while not technically mine is from another person that I sorta co-deved on. it's a way more superior fork of the program. kudos to stgiga. <a href="https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/2338">Download.</a>
        <h3>Shreddage 2 Amped with Revalver MK III.V Soundfont.</h3>
